## Requirements

- Godot 4.6 or later

## Installation

1. Copy the `addons/real-controller` folder into your project's `addons` directory

### Input Map Configuration

The controller requires the following input actions to be configured in your project:

1. Go to **Project > Project Settings > Input Map**
2. Add the following actions with their corresponding _recommended_ inputs:

| Action | Keyboard 
|--------|----------	
| `forward` | W 	
| `backward` | S 	
| `left` | A 	
| `right` | D 	
| `jump` | Space 	
| `sprint` | Left Shift 	
| `walk` | Left Alt
| `camera_mode_switch` | V

> **Note**: These input mappings are required for the controller to function properly. Make sure all actions are configured before running the scene. 


## Configuration

The controller exposes several export variables for customization:

- **Movement**: Speed, sprint speed, jump velocity
- **Camera**: Mouse sensitivity, tilt limit, rotation speed

If you think camera is too high or too low, you can change Y axis of the CameraPivot node. It will help you to adjust the camera height.
